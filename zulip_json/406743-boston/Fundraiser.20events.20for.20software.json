And we're \"spoiled\".</p>\n<p>Except I don't think we're just spoiled. I think it's just habitual. It feels weird to go out of our way to pay for free software. (Especially since there's so many to choose from, etc)</p>\n<p>Random idea came to mind - what if we had regular social fundraiser events, and the money just went to software we all like. Maybe choose something everyone forgets about and takes for granted? Chipping in at a fundraiser is something we're used to doing. Especially if it's in the form of buying a ticket, and the ticket price is inflated to cover the donation.</p>",
