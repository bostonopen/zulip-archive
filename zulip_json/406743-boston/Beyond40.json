Or, to be more specific, we are a “caucus” that looks to act as a voice for the rank-and-file members of the free-software community.</p>\n<p>Our priority is building a pipeline that can convert free-software enthusiasts into free-software <em>activists</em>. By forming local chapters across America, that opens the door towards taking direct action to aid the rest of the movement.\"</p>",
