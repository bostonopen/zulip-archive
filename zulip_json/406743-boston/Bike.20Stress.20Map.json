Cyclsom on the other hand also displays roads with lower speed limits and the locations of traffic calming measures. They also show roads that have the bicycle=shared_lane tag, which opencyclemap doesn't make note of.</p>\n<p>Consequently, I find opencyclemap easier to read if you're only looking for routes, because they're much more prominent and it's not as visually cluttered. However I do prefer Cyclosm because I get a better understanding of the road conditions, especially on roads that aren't on designated cycling routes.\"</p>",
