They are freely available, they cover material that is useful to know and is not generally encountered during self study, and, I have take Pierce's software foundations course using a previous edition of these books. Finally, I believe the topics of these books, such as programming languages, type theory, formal specifications and verification to currently be useful as well as being rather future proof.\"</p>",
