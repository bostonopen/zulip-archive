He mentioned Somerville.</p>\n<p>I was wondering if we could have a hacking afternoon at a hip Somerville cafe? Afternoon, just because of the aesthetic of it I guess, and also because I like coffee. But evening with beer would work as well (hashtag ballmerpeak). And then we could end with a social hour.</p>\n<p>Though it's just now occurring to me that a mid-day hack would be an even harder sell than evening beers in the summer, unless it's like an outdoor place with power outlets. So maybe this is more of a winter thing?</p>\n<p>Only rule I guess would be to bring something fun to work on!</p>",
